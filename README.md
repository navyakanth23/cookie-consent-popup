# 🍪 Cookie Consent Popup

This project is a simple implementation of a **cookie consent popup** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It introduces beginners to **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **localStorage usage** for basic user preference management.

## 🚀 Features

- Popup appears on first visit.
- Smooth fade-in animation using CSS transitions.
- Stores user's consent in `localStorage`.
- Popup disappears permanently once accepted.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)


## 🛠 How It Works

1. On page load, the script checks if the user has already accepted the cookie consent.
2. If not, the popup appears after a short delay (500ms).
3. When the **"Accept"** button is clicked:
   - The user's consent is saved in `localStorage`.
